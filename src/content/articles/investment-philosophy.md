# Our Investment Philosophy

At Meristem Capital, we believe in a systematic, research-driven approach to investment management. Just as a plant's meristem tissue is responsible for growth and development, our investment philosophy focuses on sustainable, long-term wealth creation.

## The Mathematics of Compound Growth

The power of compound interest is often described as the eighth wonder of the world. Mathematically, we can express this as:

\[
A = P(1 + r)^n
\]

Where:
- \(A\) is the final amount
- \(P\) is the principal investment
- \(r\) is the annual interest rate
- \(n\) is the number of years

## Risk Management

Our approach to risk management involves careful consideration of various factors:

1. **Diversification**: We spread investments across multiple asset classes to reduce risk
2. **Asset Allocation**: We use modern portfolio theory to optimize the risk-return tradeoff
3. **Regular Rebalancing**: We maintain target allocations through systematic rebalancing

The Sharpe Ratio, given by:

\[
S = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_p}
\]

Where:
- \(R_p\) is the portfolio return
- \(R_f\) is the risk-free rate
- \(\sigma_p\) is the portfolio standard deviation

This helps us quantify risk-adjusted returns and make informed decisions.

## Long-term Perspective

We believe that time in the market is more important than timing the market. Historical data shows that:

```
Annual Returns = Dividend Yield + Earnings Growth + Change in P/E Ratio
```

By focusing on high-quality investments with strong fundamentals, we aim to capture the benefits of long-term compounding while managing downside risk.

## Our Process

1. **Research**: Rigorous analysis of market conditions and individual securities
2. **Selection**: Careful selection of investments that meet our criteria
3. **Monitoring**: Continuous oversight and portfolio adjustments
4. **Communication**: Regular updates and transparent reporting

Remember: Past performance is not indicative of future results. Investment involves risk, including the possible loss of principal.
