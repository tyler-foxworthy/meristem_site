            Meristem Capital is an investment management firm that employs rigorous quantitative methods grounded in timeless value-investing principles. Rather than attempt to predict the future or chase trends, we systematically identify exceptional businesses priced below their intrinsic value—combining AI-driven insights from vast amounts of unstructured data with fundamental analysis and advanced statistical modeling.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            We believe the greatest mechanism for wealth creation in the public equity market is patient ownership of a small number of high-quality businesses, allowing returns to compound as these businesses improve their fundamentals over time. Our multi-disciplinary approach uses valuation methods designed to clearly understand risks and uncertainties, thoughtful risk management, and careful decisions about how much capital we allocate to each investment—recognizing that balancing investments properly within a portfolio matters just as much as selecting the right companies.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            We serve accredited and qualified clients, including high-net-worth individuals, family offices, and foundations, helping them maximize long-term compounding while thoughtfully managing risk and protecting their capital through periods of uncertainty.
