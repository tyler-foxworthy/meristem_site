            Meristem Capital is an investment management firm that employs rigorous quantitative methods grounded in timeless value-investing principles. Rather than attempt to predict the future or chase trends, we systematically identify exceptional businesses priced below their intrinsic value—combining AI-driven insights from vast amounts of unstructured data with fundamental analysis and advanced statistical modeling.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            We believe enduring wealth comes from disciplined, patient ownership of high-quality businesses. Our multi-disciplinary process emphasizes precise valuations, strategic risk management, and careful management of how much we invest in each opportunity—recognizing that how investments are balanced in a portfolio matters just as much as choosing the right companies.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            We serve accredited and qualified clients, including high-net-worth individuals, family offices, and foundations, helping them maximize long-term compounding while thoughtfully managing risk and protecting their capital through periods of uncertainty.
