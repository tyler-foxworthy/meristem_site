            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Investing in securities involves substantial risk, including the risk of total loss of capital. Past performance is not indicative of future results, and there is no guarantee that any investment strategy will achieve its objectives. The value of investments may fluctuate due to market conditions, economic factors, and other variables beyond our control.

            <h2 className="text-xl font-medium text-brand-700 mb-4">Performance-Based Fee Disclosure</h2>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Meristem Capital charges performance-based fees, meaning we earn fees only when portfolio performance exceeds the return of the S&P 500 index. We employ a high-water mark provision, ensuring clients do not pay fees on the same gains more than once.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-brand-600 mt-6 mb-3">Important Considerations for Performance-Based Fees:</h3>
            <ul className="space-y-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              <li><span className="font-medium">Conflicts of Interest:</span> Performance-based fees may create an incentive for Meristem Capital to take greater investment risks in pursuit of higher returns. We mitigate this risk through disciplined risk management and a long-term investment approach.</li>
              <li><span className="font-medium">Limited Eligibility:</span> Due to regulatory requirements, performance-based fee structures are available only to accredited and qualified investors as defined by the SEC. Clients must meet specific net worth and income thresholds to qualify.</li>
              <li><span className="font-medium">Regulatory Compliance:</span> Our fee structure complies with SEC Rule 205-3 and Indiana securities laws, which require us to disclose potential conflicts of interest and maintain transparency with clients.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
              Before engaging in an advisory agreement with performance-based fees, clients should carefully evaluate whether this structure aligns with their financial objectives and risk tolerance.
